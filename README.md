# book-database-program

This is a small program which creates a local SQLite database to store information about books. Upon running, a 'suggested_books.csv' will be imported into the database. From there, you can edit/delete existing books in the database, add new books to the database, or run analysis on books currently in the database. To start the program, download all files in this repository and run app.py on your machine.

Assuming you have Python 3 installed, you just need to run the below command in a Command Prompt window (Terminal on MAC) to install the needed resources to run the program:

* import sqlalchemy
